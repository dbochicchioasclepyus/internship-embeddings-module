- # Project Overview
## Introduction

Our project aims to build a platform that can be used in conferences to listen to long speeches or discussions, particularly those of a technical nature, and transcribe and summarize the speech/conference in real-time. This platform is designed to leverage the power of Azure cloud services and OpenAI's GPT for speech-to-text recognition and language processing.

The platform will provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for users attending conferences, making it easier for them to understand and engage with the content. The transcription and summarization of the speeches will be accessible in a readable and organized format, improving the overall conference experience for the attendees.
## Modules

The project will be divided into two main modules:
### 1. Speech Processing Module

This module will focus on the transcription and summarization of the speeches. It will take the raw speech data, convert it into text using Azure's Speech-to-Text service, and then use OpenAI's GPT to process the text.

The speech processing module will provide two main outputs: 
- **Raw Transcript** : This is the raw text as spoken by the speaker. It will be a faithful transcription of the speech, capturing every word spoken. 
- **Cleaned Transcript** : This is a cleaned up version of the raw transcript. It will remove any fillers, repetitions, and irrelevant information, providing a more readable and concise version of the speech. 
- **Summary** : This is a summary of the speech, broken down into sections and paragraphs. It will provide a high-level overview of the speech, highlighting the main points and key details.

The speech processing module will also leverage the provided context (about the speaker/event) to improve its understanding and summarization of the speech.
### 2. Embedding Module

This module will be responsible for managing and querying large summaries of speeches or conferences. It will use embeddings to produce high-quality summaries of long texts, and provide a way to query these summaries.

The embedding module will function as a database for storing text data about a conference or speech, and a search engine for querying this data. It will also use the stored data to improve on recursive summarization, producing better quality summaries over time.
## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to add several additional features to the platform, such as: 
- **Q&A Section** : This will be built organically with the questions that have been asked verbally during the conference, or that attendees would like to ask. 
- **Clarifications and Enrichments** : GPT will provide explanations and enrichments on the topic, clarifying key concepts and words mentioned by the speaker. 
- **Speech Quality Enhancement** : We plan to integrate with services like the Dolby API to improve the input speech quality. 
- **Auto Translation** : The platform will automatically translate the speech into the languages of the attendees.
